CLI and GUI are both different interfaces which allow you to enter commands into your operating system that provide very different experiences and options for the user.
Command line Interface or CLI for short is a way to input text based commands into your computer. It is heavily skewed towards lines of text compared to any sort of visuals or clean interface but allows for very specific commands to be entered. With its dark black box and minimalist design it seems to be somewhat harder to decipher for most people, but also provides a bare bones . On the otherhand GUI or Graphical User Interface is a way to input commands based around symbols and other unique visual icons. It provides a somewhat more clear and easy to identify interface to work with while inputting commands while also being admittedly more limited compared to CLI. CLI does allow for speedy to input commands and is more easily accessible in the sense that it works in essentially all computers without much issue.
 In short, its the difference between CLI being a more difficult but indepth in its capabilities while GUI provides a more visually optimized and easy to identify interface to work with.
