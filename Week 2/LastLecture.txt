It was a weird watch for me, but towars the later half of the lecture, he brought up parents. My family especially growing up had arugably the opposite of what Paul experienced, I had very reserved grandparents, there were no other kids my age to interact with and my mother was too busy with work to really give me the enthusiasm I wanted to pursue my interests when I was little.
However, I did get this a little later in life when I went to college, here I got plenty of mentor figures and people wanting to watch my passions grow, and they took time out of their lives outside of their jobs as professors to give this mentorship. My mom once she became more free from work gave this too, and what I took away from this in relation to Pauls lecture, is that while I didn't get to ignite my interests immediately
I was still given the quality assistence and enthusiasm from other people, my family wasn't my only support netowrk. It also taught me that people have a capacity to help others succeed and which was a mindset I had been locked into early in life where as a child, much of my enthusiasm and passion came from within
and wasn't really supported until much later in my life. I don't think thats a bad thing, but its a valuable leson to me at least that its never too late to be someones mentor or hero.
